   * Make MemoryView!
         Use dynamically-updating pBuffers for texture; get 2d texture-version working correctly first
   * Test several of the on-the-fly editing issues;
   
   * Line numbers, breakpoints correction,
   * DELAYED parsing!!!
   * Memory watchpoints!
   
   * Clear button on OutputConsole?
   * Add 'last pc' to StackView?
   * Better view of errors

Highlighting a line of Text:
   QTextEdit::setExtraSelections ( const QList<ExtraSelection> & selections )
   TextEditor::highlightLine(const QTextCursor &c, const QTextCharFormat &f);

   * Add 'Find and/or Replace' Dialog



DELAYED Parsing Ideas:
   * Main thing is updating of syntaxErrors; ErrorConsole
      * fix multiple calls to contentsChanged (inserting whitespace on Return press)

   * Know whether last errors were syntactic or semantic; attempt to use that intelligently
      * Attempt to only re-add parseNodes if non-trivial changes were made
