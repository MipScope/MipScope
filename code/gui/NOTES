Gui TODO: (stuff i'll forget, otherwise)
   * Optimize editing-on-the-fly algorithmically
   * Cleanup last-minute Syscall architechure
   * Memory watchpoints
   * Integrate Maze into MipScope
   * Ability to turn on/off implicit roll-back
   * Lots of testing
   * Have pc in regView be accurate address
   * Options panel; documentation


OLD:
   * Line numbers, breakpoints correction,
   * Add 'Find and/or Replace' Dialog
   * Better view of errors
   * Make MemoryView!
         Use dynamically-updating pBuffers for texture; get 2d texture-version working correctly first

   * Fix Restarting very fast and then segfault



   * DELAYED parsing!!!
DELAYED Parsing Ideas:
   * Main thing is updating of syntaxErrors; ErrorConsole
      * fix multiple calls to contentsChanged (inserting whitespace on Return press)

   * Know whether last errors were syntactic or semantic; attempt to use that intelligently
      * Attempt to only re-add parseNodes if non-trivial changes were made
