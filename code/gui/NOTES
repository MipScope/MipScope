Fis Restarting very fast and then segfault

Gui TODO: (stuff i'll forget, otherwise)
   * Test several of the on-the-fly editing issues;
   * Memory watchpoints!
   
   * Clear button on OutputConsole?
   * Add 'last pc' to StackView?

OLD:
   * Line numbers, breakpoints correction,
   * Add 'Find and/or Replace' Dialog
   * Better view of errors
   * Make MemoryView!
         Use dynamically-updating pBuffers for texture; get 2d texture-version working correctly first



   * DELAYED parsing!!!
DELAYED Parsing Ideas:
   * Main thing is updating of syntaxErrors; ErrorConsole
      * fix multiple calls to contentsChanged (inserting whitespace on Return press)

   * Know whether last errors were syntactic or semantic; attempt to use that intelligently
      * Attempt to only re-add parseNodes if non-trivial changes were made
